# What Notepad v2

## Description
A fully functional markdown supported notepad, powered by **MDXEditor**. 

By default, the notepad is stored in localStorage by default giving you around 5-10MB of storage varying on the browser.

Optionally you may login via GitHub OAuth. This project uses **Neon Postgres serverless** over **Drizzle-ORM**'s neon-http binding to store notepad content in the database on a per user basis.
